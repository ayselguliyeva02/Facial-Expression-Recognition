# Facial Reaction Time Series Prediction

This project focuses on predicting human facial reactions as a time series using deep learning techniques.

A hybrid architecture combining **CNN**, **RNN (LSTM/GRU)**, and **ANN** is used:
- **CNN** extracts spatial features from facial images,
- **RNN** captures temporal dependencies in facial reactions,
- **ANN** performs final classification.

Hyperparameter optimization is performed using **Optuna**, and the model is trained and evaluated on a facial expression dataset.

## Key Features
